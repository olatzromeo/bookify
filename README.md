#   Clean Architecture template project

## Description

This project is designed to implement Clean Architecture principles using Symfony 7. 
It focuses on separating system responsibilities into different layers, ensuring that business logic, infrastructure and user interfaces are decoupled. 
The goal is to provide a scalable and easy to maintain structure, applying design concepts such as dependency inversion and separation of concerns.
